# htm2111-final
Final assignment for 1006. My webpage.

app.py
The flask routing was a very important part of the assignment. I rendered all of the webpages in different functions that I called when I moved between the webpages. I also added debugging mode to help me out.

index.html
I commented on this but I decided to center everything and bold some words so it looked nice. I also changed font sizes so that it looked nice. I used href for linking (both local and external). I also added a copyright at the bottom because I was bored. 

na.html
I decided to create a page about a recent project I have been apart with. I added an image as well. 

classes.html
Created a list of my classes and and wrote a small description.
